# Hotel Booking App

This project is a **Hotel Booking App** designed for hotel personnel to book rooms at their own hotel and manage them efficiently. The app was created as part of a .NET education exercise and demonstrates skills in building desktop applications using **WinForms**, **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**, and **SQL Server**.

## Features

- **Room Booking**: Book rooms for guests based on availability.
- **Room Management**: Administrate room details such as room types, sizes, and additional features.
- **Database Integration**: The app is connected to a SQL Server database for persistent data storage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using WinForms for a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **WinForms**: A Windows-based graphical interface for the app (mandatory for the assignment).
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database management and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **SQL Server**: As the database backend.

## Purpose

This project was an exercise for my .NET education, focusing on developing desktop applications with database integration. The main objectives were:

- To learn and apply concepts of **Entity Framework Core** for database operations.
- To practice building Windows Forms applications.
- To integrate a relational database with a desktop application.
